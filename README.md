# Our Zoo  
A collaborative web application to explore and learn about animals from around the world, created by our group.

## Overview
Our Zoo is a web application designed to let users discover, read about, and enjoy information on a variety of animals. Each group member has contributed their own zoo section, making this a fun and educational resource for everyone.

## Problem Statement
Many people are curious about animals but:
- It can be hard to find reliable, fun, and simple information.
- Most zoo or animal apps are cluttered or too complex.
- Not everyone can visit a real zoo.
- Kids and adults alike want easy, visual ways to learn.
- Some resources are not mobile-friendly or accessible.

## Target Users
- Animal lovers of all ages
- Students and teachers looking for educational resources
- Families who want to explore together
- Anyone curious about wildlife

## Core Features (MVP)
- Browse a list of animals with pictures and facts
- View detailed pages for each animal
- Simple, clean navigation between each group memberâ€™s zoo
- Responsive design (works on both phone and desktop)
- Fun facts and educational content
