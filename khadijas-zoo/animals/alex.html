        * Native to Africa, lions are large carnivorous cats.
        * Males usually have a mane, which makes them stand out.
        * They live in social groups called prides.
        * They are apex predators, feeding on animals like antelopes, zebras, and buffalo.
        * Known as the "king of the jungle," though they mostly live in savannas and grasslands.
